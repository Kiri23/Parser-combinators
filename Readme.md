This repository is an example of using functional programing style to create expresive API. 
What I choose to create is library for parsing string pattern know as parser combinator.

## What I learned 
1. This code showcase how to create fluent api in a functional way. Fluent API are created chaining method 
this result in a more expresive API's 
2. i learned about functional programing concept like monad, map and chain. 
3. I learned how to pass function around , deepen my knowledge in first class function , high order function and closures 
4. Closure is used heavily to create this API in combination with functional paradimg 
5. In the examples folder fluent-api I showcase different scenarios of fluen api in actions.
